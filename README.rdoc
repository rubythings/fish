This project is intended to provide a web-based monitoring system for an Aquaponics setup.  Basic work was done a few months ago, but I've now got some time to pursue the project and will be actively developing it over the next few months.  The plan is to run the app on a raspberry pi to monitor ph, temp, water and oxygen levels in a backyard aquaponics system.
